This low poly building pack includes the "NYC buildings pack", the "skyscrapers", "residential buildings pack", "warehouses", "Barcelona low poly", "Venice low poly mobile" and many other models.

17 residential buildings, 29 skyscrapers and 23 NYC buildings, 19 Barcelona buildings, 17 Venice Buildings, 22 buildings with textures not atlased and detailed bump maps and 11 warehouses. 
139 unique building models in total.

The version 1.8 includes 22 new buildings ("barna" models)with not atlased textures. This means buildings will batch with copies of themselves only.
These buildings can be found in the "no atlased" folder. The purpouse of these buildings is to provide a higher res and more detailed textures where needed.
They use a single 1024x1024 diffuse - reflectivity map and a 1024x1024 normal map, and will provide up to 8 times higher resolution than other atlased textures, 
both the houses and the skyscrapers.



_____________________________________
How to use:

- Simply use the kind of buildings you are interested in from the "prefabs" folder.
Note that prefabs are available in "closed meshes" version in case that is required
by a plugin you are using. Some residential buildings are not available in 
"closed meshes" version, also note that these meshes are a bit higher poly count. 
Tweak diffuse texture size to fit your needs (1024x1024 / 2048x2048 max depending on texture).

- Please note that normally you will need to update the cubemap for reflectivity.
I recommend the use of this free cube map maker for Unity for building reflections:

- Also note that demo scenes use Pro camera post effects that will not be available in
Unity free. These effects are disabled by default.

- If you want to reuse demo scenes, you will find some resources used only on these scenes
inside their folder (scenes > demo# >  resources).

- For any building related material, please go to meshes > materials.
